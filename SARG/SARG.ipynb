    "A deep neural network is a function which takes as input, $x$, data, into an output, $F(x)$. The word “deep” in deep learning refers to the network being a composition of layer functions:\n",

Here $W^{T}_k$ is a matrix, representing a linear transform, (such as a convolution or a fully connected layer) and $\\sigma$ is a choice of a non-linear [activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function). The goal in deep learning is to shape our function $F$, by any means possible, by tweaking the weights till they fit the data."

    "In the spirit of giving new names to old things, I dub this the Regression Machine (a better name would be the Sparse Coding Layer, but lets stick to this).\n",
    "\n",
    "This layer behaves very differently from a regular deep learning layer and it might be worthwhile to consider what it does. $W$ is a set of weights, to be trained, and $\\lambda$ is a parameter controlling how sparse the output is. Assuming a trained model, with sensible $W$, this layer is a sparse encoder. It takes $x$, its input and transforms it into its representation in structural primitives (the columns of $W$). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to think of a musical metaphor. The sound of a chord (our input $x$) is generated by a sparse superposition of sounds corresponding to a small number of notes (our sparse parameter $y$). Our layer takes this generative process and throws it in reverse, and attempts to, from the sound of a chord, to recover the individual notes. \n",

    "[Gregor and LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/gregor-icml-10.pdf) observe that sparse coding exhibits the property of mutual inhibition.

It's no surprise then that this is the mechanism proposed by [Olshausen et al](http://redwood.psych.cornell.edu/papers/olshausen_field_1997.pdf) to represent the early stages of visual processing.\n",

Computing this layer requires the solution of a small optimization problem (on the order of the number of features in a datum). Measured in milliseconds, this may be cheap -  the cost of solving this problem is on the order of solving a linear system. But it is still an order of magnitude more expensive than a simple matrix multiplication passed through a nonlinearity. Adding a single layer like this would potentially increase the cost of every training step a hundredfold."

    "Finding the $W$'s for the network still remains a nagging problem. Fortunately, the usual set of tools apply. Given a large labeled dataset, training a stacked $k$-ARM with backpropagation is still viable. The interpretation of a neural net as a sparse code, however, lends itself to a natural heuristic for initializing $W$'s.\n",

    "With a large unlabeled dataset {$x_1,\\dots,x_n$}, the problem of finding the weights $W$ for a single Regression Machine is the [Dictionary Learning Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_dictionary_learning). Dictionary Learning learns both the $W$'s and $y_i$'s jointly, in the following (large) optimization problem:\n",

    "This technique eerily recalls our forgotten hero the [Restricted Boltzman Machine (RBM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_Boltzmann_machine). Like the RBM, it too is a form of unsupervised pre-training which learns its weights greedily. Unlike the RBM, we don't need to deal with the uncomfortable transplantation of the weights into a deep, directed network. The $k$-ARM unifies initialization and inference, making our weight surgery less jarring. \n",
